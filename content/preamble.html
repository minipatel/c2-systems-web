	Command and Control (C2) is an overloaded term. This website deals with C2 in the military context. Bright minds have already worked long and hard on defining what "command and control" mean and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control" target="_blank">Wiki article</a> sums it up nicely.<br/>
	In the articles here the terms "command" and "control" are understood, perhaps more loosely, to mean "tasking someone/something" and "guidelines/restrictions on task execution" respectively.

	On this site, you will find content about the problem space of military C2 and specifically potential technological solutions to address this.<br/>
	As it turns out the abstraction of the fundamental problems in C2 does not differ much from those of credit card payment providers, social media, betting, webshops and online games. The problem is that sometimes this realization is lost in a myriad of functional requirements and the application ultimately end up as a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/" target="_blank">big ball of mud</a>.
	I have personallly witnessed the failure of C2 systems from many operational positions and later in life from various so-called <i>governance</i> roles in IT projects.
	The failures are on all levels from a project failing to deliver expected scope, on time and on budget. In other words, many projects fail in the functional as well as qualitative scope.<br/>
	
	For this reason I started a pet project. Something to ensure that I kept trying my hand at current technologies instead of always "hiding in the books". To "always be coding".</br> 
	The philosophy behind my software project was a challenge to take an <i>architecture first</i> approach - secondly, use only free open source libraries - and thirdly, see if that may end up solving some functional problems in the business domain along the way ...<br/>
