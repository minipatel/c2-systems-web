	Command and Control (C2) is an overloaded term. This website deals with C2 in the military context. Smart people have already worked long and hard on defining what these words mean and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control" target="_blank">Wiki article</a> sums it up nicely.

<p>
	Here, you will find content about the problem space of C2 and specifically the technological solutions to address this.<br/>
	As it turns out the fundamental problems of C2 may not be much different than the problems of banks, webshops, online games etc. The problem is that sometimes this realization gets lost in a myriad of functional requirements in the business domain and ultimately end up in a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/" target="_blank">big ball of mud</a>.
	For this reason the philosophy behind the software project will take an <i>architecture first</i> approach - and hopefully it may end up solving some business domain problems in the process.
